# Dog-Vision (🐶👁): Using Computer Vision to classify dog photos into different breeds.

* **Topics:** TensorFlow, deep learning and transfer learning.
* **Domain:** Computer vision.
* **Data:** Images of dogs from [Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/) (120 dog breeds, 20,000+ images).
* **Problem type:** Multi-class classification (120 different classes).

Welcome, welcome!

The focus of this notebook is to give a quick overview of deep learning with TensorFlow.

How?

We're going to go through the machine learning workflow steps and build a computer vision project to classify photos of dogs into their respective dog breed.

TK - image of workflow - e.g. dog photo -> model -> dog breed
